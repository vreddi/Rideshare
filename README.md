SplitRide provides users with a platform to collaboratively travel to their desired destinations.
Our user-base is comprised of college-students and faculty members which enhances the 
SplitRide experience to be more communal and safer. With a simple search query, passengers are 
matched with appropriate drivers and are connected to each other for the ride. The expenses are split 
between the travelers based on driver's criteria to make the journey enjoyable and beneficial for all.
